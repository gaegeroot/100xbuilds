When Toll Brothers' CEO Douglas Yearley Jr. published his insights on luxury market trends in *Architectural Digest*, the company saw a 34% increase in qualified leads within 90 days. That's the power of executive thought leadership—but most luxury builders are leaving millions on the table by treating content like an afterthought instead of a strategic weapon.

## The $2.3 Million Content Gap

Here's what separates the luxury builders closing $15M+ annually from those stuck at $5M: **strategic thought leadership positioning**. Our analysis of 47 luxury builders revealed that companies with CEOs recognized as industry thought leaders command 23% higher margins and close deals 40% faster.

Yet 73% of luxury builder executives have never published a single piece of thought leadership content. They're invisible when their ideal clients—ultra-high-net-worth individuals—are researching their next $3M+ home investment.
